# 🎙️ Emotion Recognition from Voice using Machine Learning

## 😃🔊 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based system that detects **emotions from raw human voice recordings** — without relying on speech-to-text. By analyzing **acoustic features** such as pitch, MFCCs, tone, and spectrograms, the model classifies speech into emotional states like *happy, sad, angry, neutral*, and more.

> ⚡ Built to be **language-independent**, this system is ideal for real-time applications in **mental health monitoring**, **empathetic voice assistants**, and **customer service analytics**.
